## Problem Statement
Most PDF modification and merging tools cost a fair amount or are poorly-implemented web solutions. This creates a 
problem when you need to merge several, or in my case potentially hundreds of PDF files.

## Solution
After spending far too much time dealing with other "free" solutions to this issue, I decided to see if I could 
tackle the problem myself. The result is this simple application that I will continue to use moving forwards. The 
application has only three buttons that trigger functions for the program:

* ADD: Adds any number of PDFs to the list of PDFs to merge
* MERGE: Request save destination and save merged file there
* CLEAR: Reset list of PDFs to merge

The box encompassing the right portion of the screen is where all the PDFs currently slotted for merge are listed.
